The most difficult thing about this workshop was understanding and using the virtual function. I understood the concept that the derived class could use the member variable member function of the base class through inheritance. Still, it was difficult to understand the idea that the member functions could be declared as pure virtual functions in the base class and the unimplemented functions could be used through imposition in the derived class. The challenges I encountered highlighted the importance of following correct coding practices and utilizing the right tools and features to solve problems efficiently. With the guidance of the instructors and assistance from my peers, I was able to overcome these obstacles and acquire a better understanding of the intricacies of inheritance in C++ programming.
