When I was doing the DIY workshop, I had a lot of time to analyze the LAB source code. To finish this workshop, it took a lot of time to understand the source code in the LAB and how to implement it in DIY. // refer from googling   void displayGpa(const struct GPA* displayGpa)  {    cout.precision(1);    cout << fixed << displayGpa->stno << ": "          << displayGpa->gpa << " ("          << displayGpa->name <<")" << endl;  }In the process of displaying the GPA data received from the structure, a problem occurred when the value of gpa was an integer, not a decimal.In c++, displaying using cout function required different functions to show decimal points. In other words, fixed and precious functions were required to adjust the cout decimal place. In this workshop, I learned to analyze a given source code and apply it to the functions I want to implement.
