During the course of this workshop, I encountered significant challenges in grasping the concept of inheritance in C++ programming. Understanding the relationship between the base class and the derived class, as well as accessing the private data members of the base class, required a considerable amount of time and effort. Additionally, comprehending how the derived class could modify the other required functions while inheriting member functions from the base class through parameters proved to be particularly challenging.
Despite the obstacles faced during the workshop, I found it to be an invaluable learning experience that helped deepen my understanding of C++ programming. The challenges I encountered highlighted the importance of following correct coding practices and utilizing the right tools and features to solve problems efficiently. With the guidance of the instructors and assistance from my peers, I was able to overcome these obstacles and acquire a better understanding of the intricacies of inheritance in C++ programming.
