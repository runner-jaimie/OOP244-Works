This workshop gave me an opportunity to explore the usefulness and convenience of function templates. As I will encounter this concept frequently in my upcoming OOP345 course, I want to delve deeper into the topic and prepare for next semester. While implementing simple validation was a good start in this workshop, I hope to add more functions in future projects.
Function templates are a powerful tool in C++ that allows me to create a function that can work with different data types. This makes my code more flexible and reusable. In OOP345, I think, I will learn how to use function templates extensively in the context of object-oriented programming.
To prepare for my next semester, I can start by practicing creating and using function templates with different data types. I can also explore the various features and functionalities of function templates, such as specialization and overloading. By doing so, I will be better equipped to handle the challenges of OOP345.
