The workshop on C++ programming proved to be a challenging but rewarding experience. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out the best way to access classes. Initially, I thought that changing the member data from private to public would be the easiest solution. However, I soon realized that the correct approach was to access other classes through member functions. This was a valuable lesson that emphasized the importance of following proper coding practices and respecting the encapsulation of classes.

Throughout the workshop, I learned about several important functions in C++ programming, including "with()", "fill()", "setf()", and "unsetf()". These functions play a crucial role in formatting and manipulating input/output streams, and I gained a deeper understanding of their usage. I discovered that these functions can be very useful in improving the efficiency and readability of code, and I can see myself utilizing them in future projects.

In conclusion, the workshop was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of C++ programming. The challenges I encountered during the workshop helped me to appreciate the importance of following proper coding practices and using the right tools and functions to solve problems. I am confident that my knowledge and skills in C++ programming will be useful in future development projects.
