The C++ programming workshop was both challenging and rewarding, and one of the toughest parts was understanding the Rule of Three. This rule states that if one of the three special functions is declared in the program, the other two must also be implemented, otherwise the program may suffer from serious memory leaks.

Another area that initially caused some confusion was reading and writing files. However, with practice and determination, I was able to master this concept and improve my skills.

Overall, this workshop provided a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of C++ programming. The challenges I faced underscored the importance of adhering to best coding practices and utilizing the appropriate tools and features to solve problems. I am confident that the knowledge and skills I gained through this workshop will prove useful in my future endeavors.
