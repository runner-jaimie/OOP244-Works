The C++ programming workshop was both challenging and rewarding. The most difficult aspect of the workshop was learning to use various operators. Prior to this workshop, I had only worked with the basic +, -, prefix, and postfix operators for variables. However, I learned in this workshop that I can directly calculate the value in a class object by overloading operators. At first, I struggled with the concept and was unsure how to apply it. However, through the Lab and DIY exercises, I was able to practice and develop my skills in using overloading operators.

In conclusion, the workshop was a valuable learning experience that deepened my understanding of C++ programming. The challenges I faced during the workshop highlighted the importance of following proper coding practices and using the right tools and functions to solve problems. I am confident that the knowledge and skills I acquired through this workshop will be useful in future.
