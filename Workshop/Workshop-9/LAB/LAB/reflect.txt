Understanding derivative classes as resources was the most challenging part of a recent workshop I attended. I learned that it's crucial to consider memory management, resource cleanup, and exception safety when creating derived classes that use resources. Initially, I made the mistake of assuming that I didn't need to call the parent class separately since I inherited it through copy assignment, but I soon realized that this was incorrect.

This experience emphasized the importance of following best coding practices and utilizing the right tools and features to efficiently solve problems. With guidance from Fardad professor's youtube lecture, I was able to overcome these obstacles and gain a better understanding of the complexity of inheritance in C++ programming. Overall, this workshop taught me the value of careful planning and attention to detail when creating derived classes with resources in C++.
